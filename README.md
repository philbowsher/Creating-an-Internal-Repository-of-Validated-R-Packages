PharmaSUG 2022: SI-187 : Creating an Internal Repository of Validated R Packages

## Directions

- Ensure dependencies are available
  - `docker` CLI and docker engine to run RSPM
  - An `RSPM_LICENSE` environment variable with a valid license

- Take a look at [./steps.sh](./steps.sh)
  - Keep in mind these steps are not a _script_ to run. They are steps to follow

- Generate your own [`example.csv`](./example.csv) to show your curated repository of validated R packages
    - This example has 300+ packages
